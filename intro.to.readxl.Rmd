library(writexl)
library(here)




# install.packages("package_name") <!--comment hidden, this comment is hidden but not #install-->

###Read in fish counts

##### Read in the fish_counts_curated.csv

fish.counts<- read.csv(here("r.workshop","fish_counts_curated.csv")  <!-- not working becasue of folder location-->
```
